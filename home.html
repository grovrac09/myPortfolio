        <h2>Why do I want to be a software engineer?</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was little, I thought computers were cool. I'd watch Abby tap away at her keyboard on NCIS and think about the endless possibilities I could have from learning more.</p>
        <p>I didn't get the chance to attend university, and online learning was difficult alongside work. Luckily, my employer opened an apprenticeship for software engineering, which means I have the chance to learn and work, all at once!</p>

    <h2>My targets</h2>
    <p>My end goal is to become a security engineer, and help companies defend themselves against the ever-growing threat of cybercriminals.</p>
    <p>It's a long way in the future, but I plan to achieve this by..</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Completing my CodeNation learning to gain my level 4 qualifiaction in software development.</li><br>
        <li>Continuing to learn with my employer, and branch out to more services than just web.</li><br>
        <li>Creating more <a target="_blank" href="projects.html">projects</a> to build my knowledge.</li><br>
